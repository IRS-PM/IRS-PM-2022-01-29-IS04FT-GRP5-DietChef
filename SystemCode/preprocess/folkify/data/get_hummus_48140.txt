{"recipe":{"publisher":"101 Cookbooks","ingredients":["Fourth of July Roasted Tomato Salsa","- A deliciously vibrant, earthy, and slightly smoky-tasting salsa recipe. Different from salsa fresca, the deep, caramelized flavors of the roasted tomatoes and onions alongside the smokiness of the chipotles make for a richly beautiful and balanced salsa.","Lime & Peanut Coleslaw","- This feather-light, mayo-free, coleslaw recipe uses toasted peanuts, cherry tomatoes, and lime vinaigrette and is perfect alongside fajitas, or whatever you have coming off the grill.","My Favorite Grilled Kabob Recipe","(with muhammara) - A kabob recipe featuring grilled mushrooms, lemons, tofu red onions and a delicious red pepper walnut slather.","TLT Sandwich","(done on the grill) - A vegetarian TLT sandwich inspired by the classic BLT sandwich. This version includes chipotle-marinated tempeh alongside oven-roasted cherry tomatoes, a bit of shredded lettuce, and a generous avocado slather on a thin slice (or two) of great bread.","Giant Black Bean Salad","- A twist on the ubiquitous black bean salad - giant black beans and toasted almonds are tossed with a honey-jalapeno-lime dressing and served with a bit of crumbled feta over a bed of baby arugula.","Orzo Super Salad","- An orzo salad packed with nutritious ingredients - asparagus, almonds, feta, sprouts, broccoli, cucumber, and a zesty lemon dressing. For those of you still seeing asparagus in season.","Heather's Quinoa","- A one-skillet quinoa recipe - quinoa, corn, chopped kale and pan-toasted tofu tossed with a big dollop of pesto and finished off with a few roasted cherry tomatoes.","A Twist on Guacamole","- My very favorite guacamole recipe. Served with toasted naan bread (or chips!), I've added a couple pinches of cumin and curry powder to incorporate a slightly unexpected flavor profile.","Hummus en Fuego","- A beautiful, spicy hummus recipe made from pureed garbanzo beans, toasted walnuts, and spicy crushed red pepper oil finished with a few chopped olives and a bit of cilantro."],"source_url":"http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/fourth-of-july-recipes-recipe.html","recipe_id":"48140","image_url":"http://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/images/fourth_of_july_recipes3bea.jpg","social_rank":38.67068758652924,"publisher_url":"http://www.101cookbooks.com","title":"Fourth of July Recipes"}}
